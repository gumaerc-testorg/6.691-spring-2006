The following MATLAB® scripts were provided to students in the course.

Sample Simulation Scripts
-------------------------

Simulation Subroutine ([M]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/sf))  
This is a function script that generates the derivatives of the state variables. It is called repeatedly by ode23 and so should be efficient.

Main Script ([M]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/fsim))  
This is the MATLAB® program that runs the simulation.
